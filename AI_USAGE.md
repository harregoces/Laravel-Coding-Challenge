# AI Usage Disclosure (highly encouraged)

We use AI tools too, and we understand how powerful these tools are in the hands of a skilled ane experienced practitioner.  
If you used any AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) in a **meaningful** way, please describe:

- What tasks you asked AI to help with
- The exact code areas affected (files, lines/sections)
- What you kept vs. changed after review
- Any risks you identified in the AI’s suggestions

We value transparency and engineering judgment. This does not count against you; it helps us understand your workflow.
