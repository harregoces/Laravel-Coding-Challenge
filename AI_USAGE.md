# AI Usage Disclosure (optional but encouraged)

If you used AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) in a **meaningful** way, please describe:

- What tasks you asked AI to help with
- The exact code areas affected (files, lines/sections)
- What you kept vs. changed after review
- Any risks you identified in the AI’s suggestions

We value transparency and engineering judgment. This does not count against you; it helps us understand your workflow.
