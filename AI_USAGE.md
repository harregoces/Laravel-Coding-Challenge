# AI Usage Disclosure (highly encouraged)

We use AI tools too, and we understand how powerful these tools are in the hands of a skilled ane experienced practitioner.  
If you used any AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) in a **meaningful** way, please describe:

- What tasks you asked AI to help with
- The exact code areas affected (files, lines/sections)
- What you kept vs. changed after the AI review? Why?
- Any risks you identified in the AI’s suggestions

We value transparency and engineering judgment. How you work with AI and what value you can bring to the team using AI tools is very important to us.  his does not count against you; it helps us understand your workflow.
